## Run your own AI Chat Bot ðŸ¤–

</br>

Works with GPT 3.5 turbo and chat history but should also work with Chat GPT 4 you just need the api key for it. Is able to do lists, bullet points, email templates and code blocks. Saved chat history, huge list of prompts added âŒµ

Add your Open AI API Key and run it on your local network http://localhost:5000 or with https:// your.domain.com either one works!

</br>

### Built with python, flask, node.js and react for x86_64 (amd64) architectures and should work on docker desktop also. 

</br>


## Clone the repo
---
</br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigsk1/TKS-GPT.git
```

```bash
cd TKS-GPT
```
</br>


## Install with Docker CLI / Docker Compose

### The simplest way is with Docker - pull straight from dockerhub

https://hub.docker.com/r/bigsk1/tks-gpt

---
</br>
Docker


```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name tks-gpt --env OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key --restart always bigsk1/tks-gpt:latest
```

</br>

Docker compose

```bash
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: bigsk1/tks-gpt:latest
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

</br>

### Build the image yourself
---

You can use docker cli in same folder as the Dockerfile

```bash
docker build -t your_image_name .
```
```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name tksgpt-container --env OPENAI_API_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_OPEN_AI_APIKEY_HERE your_image_name
```

or
</br>

In the docker-compose.yml file add your Open AI Api key 

```bash
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    image: your_custom_image_name
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```
and then 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Your app will be running on http://localhost:5000 use it as is or add ssl both work with no code change needed. 

</br>


## Build on Ubuntu or Debian
---
</br>

THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO YOUR PROJECT A BACKEND AND A FRONTEND
### BACKEND - python3 and flask
</br>

Active Virtual Enviroment ( optional but recommended )


For Python, you'll need to create a virtual environment. In your project directory, run:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Python dependencies:

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Exit out of virtual enviroment and back to the TKS-GPT folder type deactivate


</br>

### FRONTEND - node and react


Install Node.js and npm:

Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You can check if they are installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
You need Node version 18+


If not installed, you can download them from the official Node.js website https://nodejs.org/en/download/

</br>

See here https://github.com/nodesource/distributions

Install frontend dependencies:

### Ubuntu 22.04

---

Node (v19.x) to current
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl
```
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | sudo -E bash - &&\
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

### Debian

---

Node (v19.x) to current
```bash
sudo apt install curl
```
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | bash - &&\
apt-get install -y nodejs
```
run as root on debian
```bash
apt-get install -y build-essential
```
</br>

Navigate to the frontend folder (the folder containing the package.json file, e.g., chatbot-ui), and install the required npm packages:

```bash
cd chatbot-ui
npm install
```

To connect the front-end to the back-end


Install Axios in your chatbot-ui folder:

```bash
npm install axios
```

Set up environment variables:  

Make sure you have a .env file in (TKS-GPT folder) with the required environment variables (such as OPENAI_API_KEY). 

### Change .env.template to .env
</br>

After completing these steps, you should be able to run both the backend and frontend servers and start using your chatbot application.

```
</br>

 ### Backend: The Flask backend is in the TKS-GPT directory. It serves the chatbot API and the React frontend (static files in chatbot-ui/build).

</br>

 ### Frontend: The React frontend is in the chatbot-ui directory. It contains the main App.js file where the axios API call is made to the Flask backend.



</br>

 Axios: Axios is used in the App.js file to make an HTTP POST request to the Flask backend's /chat endpoint. The request contains the user's message, and the response from the server contains the AI-generated message.

</br>

 React: React is used for building the frontend user interface. The project was created using Create React App, and it uses components and state management with hooks (e.g., useState).

</br>

 Node.js: Node.js is used as the underlying runtime environment for running the development server (npm start) and for building the production-ready static files (npm run build). It also manages the dependencies through package.json

</br>

 The frontend and backend communicate via an API call made with axios from the App.js file. When the user enters a message and clicks the "Send" button, the frontend sends an HTTP POST request to the backend's /chat endpoint. The backend processes the request, interacts with the GPT model, and returns the AI-generated response, which the frontend then displays.

</br>

### Run your project

---

</br>


```bash
cd TKS-GPT/chatbot-ui
```
```bash
npm run build
```



</br>

In the TKS-GPT project folder

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
python3 app.py
```
</br>



On ubuntu you can use systemd to create a service to keep running even after a restart


make file for systemd service
add your own user, group and path's

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tkschat.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=TKS Chat Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
User=edit_for_user  ( normally your user name )
Group=edit_for_group  ( normally your user name )
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/flask/app/TKS-GPT
Environment="PATH=/path/to/your/TKS-GPT/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/path/to/your/venv/bin/python3 app.py
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and exit the file.

Reload the systemd daemon to register your new service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable your service to start at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tkschat.service
```

Start your service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start tkschat.service
```

Now, your Flask app will automatically start when the system boots up. To check the status of your service, use the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status tkschat.service
```

You can also stop, restart, or disable the service using systemctl commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop tkschat.service
sudo systemctl restart tkschat.service
sudo systemctl disable tkschat.service
```

check systemd logs for errors

```bash
journalctl -u tkschat.service
```
</br>

## Set up a Cloudflare Tunnel for https (optional)
https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide

</br>

Your App will be on http://YOUR-LOCAL-IP-ADDRESS:5000

</br>

The easiest way is to use the UI in zero trust and make a tunnel and assign it a domain or subdomain. Allow your domain as origin, POST and GET methods, all headers.

</br>

---

</br>

Want to make updates and changes and using systemd? 

first stop systemd server for flask using

```bash
sudo systemctl stop tkschat.service
```

in  /TKS-GPT/chatbot-ui

```bash
npm run build
```

once built can enabled again using 

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tkschat.service
```

## Run on a Devcontainer VSCode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigsk1/TKS-GPT.git
```
```bash
cd TKS-GPT
```


Open in Dev Container and when asked in terminal enter Open Ai Api Key, browse to localhost:5000
